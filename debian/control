Description: Identify, read, write, erase, and verify BIOS/ROM/flash chips
 flashrom is a tool for identifying, reading, writing, verifying and erasing
 flash chips. It's often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware/optionROM
 images in-system using a supported mainboard, but it also supports flashing of
 network cards (NICs), SATA controller cards, and other external devices which
 can program flash chips.
 .
 It supports a wide range of DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32/40/48,
 and BGA chips, which use various protocols such as LPC, FWH, parallel
 flash, or SPI.
 .
 The tool can be used to flash BIOS/firmware images for example -- be it
 proprietary BIOS images or coreboot (previously known as LinuxBIOS) images.
 .
 It can also be used to read the current existing BIOS/firmware from a
 flash chip.
 .
 Currently supported programmers include:
 .
   * internal (for in-system flashing in the mainboard)
   * dummy (virtual programmer for testing flashrom)
   * nic3com (for flash ROMs on 3COM network cards)
   * nicrealtek (for flash ROMs on Realtek and SMC 1211 network cards)
   * nicnatsemi (for flash ROMs on National Semiconductor DP838* network cards)
   * nicintel (for parallel flash ROMs on Intel 10/100Mbit network cards)
   * gfxnvidia (for flash ROMs on NVIDIA graphics cards)
   * drkaiser (for flash ROMs on Dr. Kaiser PC-Waechter PCI cards)
   * satasii (for flash ROMs on Silicon Image SATA/IDE controllers)
   * satamv (for flash ROMs on Marvell SATA controllers)
   * atahpt (for flash ROMs on Highpoint ATA/RAID controllers)
   * atavia (for flash ROMs on VIA VT6421A SATA controllers)
   * atapromise (for flash ROMs on Promise PDC2026x ATA/RAID controllers)
   * it8212 (for flash ROMs on ITE IT8212F ATA/RAID controller)
   * ft2232_spi (for SPI flash ROMs attached to an FT2232/FT4232H/FT232H family
     based USB SPI programmer), including the DLP Design DLP-USB1232H,
     FTDI FT2232H Mini-Module, FTDI FT4232H Mini-Module, openbiosprog-spi,
     Amontec JTAGkey/JTAGkey-tiny/JTAGkey-2, Dangerous Prototypes Bus Blaster,
     Olimex ARM-USB-TINY/-H, Olimex ARM-USB-OCD/-H, TIAO/DIYGADGET USB
     Multi-Protocol Adapter (TUMPA), TUMPA Lite, GOEPEL PicoTAP,
     Google Servo v1/v2, and FIC OpenMoko Neo1973 Debug board.
   * serprog (for flash ROMs attached to a programmer speaking serprog),
     including AVR flasher by Urja Rannikko, AVR flasher by eightdot,
     Arduino Mega flasher by fritz, InSystemFlasher by Juhana Helovuo,
     and atmegaXXu2-flasher by Stefan Tauner.
   * buspirate_spi (for SPI flash ROMs attached to a Bus Pirate)
   * dediprog (for SPI flash ROMs attached to a Dediprog SF100)
   * rayer_spi (for SPI flash ROMs attached to a RayeR parport based programmer)
   * pony_spi (for SPI flash ROMs attached to a SI-Prog serial port
     bitbanging adapter)
   * nicintel_spi (for SPI flash ROMs on Intel Gigabit network cards)
   * ogp_spi (for SPI flash ROMs on Open Graphics Project graphics card)
   * linux_spi (for SPI flash ROMs accessible via /dev/spidevX.Y on Linux)
   * usbblaster_spi (for SPI flash ROMs attached to an Altera USB-Blaster)
   * nicintel_eeprom (for SPI EEPROMs on Intel Gigabit network cards)
   * mstarddc_spi (for SPI flash ROMs accessible through DDC in MSTAR-equipped
     displays)
   * pickit2_spi (for SPI flash ROMs accessible via Microchip PICkit2)
   * ch341a_spi (for SPI flash ROMs attached to WCH CH341A)
