Description: Identify, read, write, erase, and verify BIOS/ROM/flash chips
 flashrom is a tool for identifying, reading, writing, verifying and erasing
 flash chips. It's often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware images
 in-system using a supported mainboard, but it also supports flashing of
 network cards (NICs), SATA controller cards, and other external devices which
 can program flash chips.
 .
 It supports a wide range of DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32, and
 TSOP40 chips, which use various protocols such as LPC, FWH, parallel flash,
 or SPI.
 .
 The tool can be used to flash BIOS/firmware images for example -- be it
 proprietary BIOS images or coreboot (previously known as LinuxBIOS) images.
 .
 It can also be used to read the current existing BIOS/firmware from a
 flash chip.
