flashrom (0.0+r3073-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #462248).
    + Flashrom is now installed in /usr/sbin instead of /usr/bin.
    + The manpage is now in section 8 (not 1).
    + Fix broken references to old bug tracker URL (Closes: #460554).
  * Restrict list of architectures to the known-working ones for now.
    More architectures will gradually be re-added if we're sure they work.
    + These are known to work: amd64, i386, kfreebsd-amd64, kfreebsd-i386
    + These should work (untested, though): alpha, hurd-i386, ia64,
      netbsd-alpha, netbsd-i386
    + These are disabled for now, as flashrom will very likely not work: arm,
      armel, armeb, hppa, m32r, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, sh, sparc, s390
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes required).
  * debian/control:
     + Add Homepage field.
     + Update package description.
  * debian/copyright: Update URLs and list of authors.
  * Simplified packaging a bit.

flashrom (0.0+r2769-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Do not attempt to build flashrom on S/390, as it doesn't build
    and is not useful there anyway (Closes: #404342, #418712).
    It is yet to be determined on which other architectures flashrom can
    work and on which not.
  * Honour DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip variable by removing hardcoded 'strip'
    invocation in the Makefile and letting cdbs handle it (Closes: #436850).

flashrom (0.0+r2526-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Do not compile in DoC support (it's considered unsupported upstream).
    This will also make the flash part identification process a lot faster.
