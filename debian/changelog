flashrom (0.9+r631-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
     + The command line usage has changed a bit in this release:
        + Combined operations like -wv or -Ewv are no longer allowed.
        + The -w option automatically does an auto-verify after writing
          (but you can also explicitly do it via 'flashrom -v file').
        + The -E option is also automatically verified per default.
     + Support for external programmers was added (-p), see manpage.
     + Acer Aspire One is now marked unsupported upstream (Closes: #528308).
  * Add build-dependency on libftdi-dev, flashrom now supports an
    external libftdi-based programmer (ft2232spi).
  * debian/patches/20_drop_svndef.patch: Drop, we use 'make tarball' now,
    which properly handles svn version printing in flashrom.
  * Standards-Version: 3.8.2 (no changes required).
  * debian/copyright: Update.

flashrom (0.0+r3274-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    + pciutils-dev was renamed to libpci-dev (Closes: #478379).
    + Drop ia64 from architectures list for now, unlikely to work.
    + Don't link with -lz anymore, don't build-depend on zlib1g-dev.
      We don't explicitly need zlib, libpci-dev now properly depends on it.
  * Add upstream changelog ('svn log' output) to the package (Closes: #467398).

flashrom (0.0+r3073-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #462248).
    + Flashrom is now installed in /usr/sbin instead of /usr/bin.
    + The manpage is now in section 8 (not 1).
    + Fix broken references to old bug tracker URL (Closes: #460554).
  * Restrict list of architectures to the known-working ones for now.
    More architectures will gradually be re-added if we're sure they work.
    + These are known to work: amd64, i386, kfreebsd-amd64, kfreebsd-i386
    + These should work (untested, though): alpha, hurd-i386, ia64,
      netbsd-alpha, netbsd-i386
    + These are disabled for now, as flashrom will very likely not work: arm,
      armel, armeb, hppa, m32r, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, sh, sparc, s390
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes required).
  * debian/control:
     + Add Homepage field.
     + Update package description.
  * debian/copyright: Update URLs and list of authors.
  * Simplified packaging a bit.

flashrom (0.0+r2769-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Do not attempt to build flashrom on S/390, as it doesn't build
    and is not useful there anyway (Closes: #404342, #418712).
    It is yet to be determined on which other architectures flashrom can
    work and on which not.
  * Honour DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nostrip variable by removing hardcoded 'strip'
    invocation in the Makefile and letting cdbs handle it (Closes: #436850).

flashrom (0.0+r2526-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Do not compile in DoC support (it's considered unsupported upstream).
