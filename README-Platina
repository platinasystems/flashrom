This version of flashrom is patched to support Broadwell-DE FLASH programming.

See the following discussion:

    https://www.flashrom.org/pipermail/flashrom/2016-August/014756.html

These changes are not in upstream yet. Additionally, there is a layout file for
the Platina-MK1 which places the BIOS in the last 8MiB of a 16MiB flash.

To read the current flash into a file:

sudo /usr/local/sbin/flashrom -p internal -l /usr/local/share/flashrom/layouts/platina-mk1.xml -i bios -r platina.rom

To write the coreboot.rom file on a device:

sudo /usr/local/sbin/flashrom -p internal -l /usr/local/share/flashrom/layouts/platina-mk1.xml -i bios -w coreboot-platina-mk1.rom -A -V
